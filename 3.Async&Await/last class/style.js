blocking code vs non blocking code
=> blocking code
Blocking code refers to operations that halt the execution of further code until the current operation completes. This is common with synchronous operations.

=> non blocking code
Non-blocking code, often asynchronous, allows the execution of other tasks while waiting for a current operation to complete. JavaScript handles non-blocking code using callbacks, promises, async/await, and other asynchronous mechanisms.
